# Kubernetes 101

[![Built with Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/img/devbox/shield_moon.svg)](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/contributor-quickstart/)

This repo is a collection of Kubernetes examples, ranging from the basics to CI/CD and control plane integrations. To get started, the following dependencies need to be installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/manuals/)
- [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/)

If you'd rather not use Devbox, you can manually install the dependencies listed in the `devbox.json` file under the "packages" section.
